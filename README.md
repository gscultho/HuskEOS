Real-Time Operating System

Real-Time Operating System developed for ARM Cortex-M4 as a hobbyist project. RTOS features include flags, mailboxes, FIFO buffers, counting semaphores, mutexes (with priority inheritance), and a priority-based preemptive scheduler. RTOS is fully portable to other microcontrollers dependent on changes to CPU interface layer.
